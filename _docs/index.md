## Getting Started

The Newton Web Framework is written in C++ allowing you to create compiled web server applications using the
C++ language. You can set up your project using CMake, and link to Newton as a static library when you compile
your application. We show you how you can set up your Newton project on our page on [Creating a Project](../projects/) in the documentation here.
