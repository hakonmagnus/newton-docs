        <h1>Newton C++ Web Framework</h1>
        <p>
            Newton is a full-stack web framework written in C++ allowing you to create compiled
            server applications in C++ with a front-end compiled from the Newton Client Language (NCL).

            <p class="lead">
                Newton is an ambitious hobby project of mine when I started considering if there could
                be a powerful server framework written in C++ allowing you to compile your web applications
                and avoid source code interpretation on the fly. The Newton Framework leverages <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> as a build system for projects and can use any modern C++ compiler.
                The Newton server application can have multiple virtual hosts, or one for 'localhost', and
                this virtual host can have middlewares and routes. The middlewares can be programmed by you,
                me, or someone else, and the routes can be dynamic and user-implemented to respond to the
                HTTP request however you would like. One thing you can do with routes is return an NCL
                front-end web application using my Newton Client Language. The NCL language compiles into
                client-side HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly.
